# Python homework

This floder contins a collection of homeworks that I've done during epam cloud course in 2021.

## Python homework 1

The goal of this homework was to work with different types of data: print data's type and perform predefined actions depending on the type of data.

After you pullded the repo you can just **cd** into **python** directory and run the script using


```python3 python-homework-1```

and enjoy the output of the command in the terminal of your choice.

## Python homework 2

This homework's goal was to work with different ways to format data from good old **%** (modulo) to more advanced **.format** and **f-string** ways of formatting data.

There are three functions that take data from **Metrics** class and formats the data using:
- f-string
- .format
- %
formatting types.

Then each of them is tested using **unittest** class against functions written by the lecturer.
Obviously the goal is to run all tests without errors. I played around with tests and edited them a little, you can look it up in the history of commits.

As with the first homeork you can just run

```python3 python-homework-2.py```
to test whether it works or throws out any errors.
